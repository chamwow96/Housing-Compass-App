        "They are low-cost, easy to implement, and help communities with limited capacity address affordability "
        "and quality concerns without requiring extensive funding or staff. Ideal for small towns, weak markets, or minimal capacity scenarios."
    ),
    "Preservation & Stabilization (PS)": (
        "These tools help maintain and improve the existing housing stock, protecting residents "
        "from displacement and preserving affordable units. Examples include community land trusts, "
        "acquisition/rehab grants, housing trust funds, and code enforcement/rehab loan programs. "
        "Effective in communities with aging housing or moderate funding/staff capacity. "
        "They prevent further deterioration and can stabilize neighborhoods, but require upfront capital and ongoing management."
    ),
    "Regulatory Supply (RS)": (
        "Regulatory strategies increase housing supply through zoning and planning changes. "
        "Examples: upzoning, inclusionary zoning (if legally allowed), ADU allowances, density bonuses. "
        "These tools are most effective in hot or stable markets with development pressure. "
        "Constraints include state preemption, potential local opposition, and administrative complexity. "
        "They help create long-term housing availability, but poorly designed programs may slow development or trigger NIMBY pushback."
    ),
    "Development Incentives (DI)": (
        "Incentive programs encourage private developers to build housing that meets community goals. "
        "Examples: fee waivers, expedited permitting, tax abatements, public land disposition, gap financing. "
        "Most effective in active development markets where additional subsidies or process speed-ups can overcome cost barriers. "
        "These tools can be politically sensitive, require financial resources, and may benefit developers more than residents directly."
    ),
    "Financial Assistance (FA)": (
        "Direct financial support helps residents afford housing in the short term and reduces displacement. "
        "Examples: rental subsidies, down payment assistance, property tax circuit breakers, mortgage assistance. "
        "Effective in communities with affordability pressures and moderate or strong fiscal/admin capacity. "
        "Trade-offs include ongoing funding commitment and limited reach per program, but they provide immediate relief to households."
    ),
    "Tenant Protections (TP)": (
        "Legal protections for renters stabilize households and reduce displacement risk. "
        "Examples: just-cause eviction, rent stabilization, right to counsel, junk fee limits. "
        "Most effective in hot markets with strong tenant organizing or advocacy. "
        "Constraints include state preemption in some areas, potential impact on rental supply if overly restrictive, "
        "and administrative/enforcement costs. These tools complement financial assistance and preserve housing stability."
